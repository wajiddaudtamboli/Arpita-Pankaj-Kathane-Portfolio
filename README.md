# Premium Director Portfolio Website — Dr. Arpita Kathane

## Overview
A high-end, production-ready corporate portfolio website built with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + Framer Motion. The site will feel like a handcrafted premium agency build — not a template.

- **Glassmorphism** cards in Hero section
- **Smooth Framer Motion** scroll-triggered animations on every section
- **Gradient backgrounds**, subtle grain textures, and animated blobs for depth

## 🏗️ Architecture & Systems

### Theme System (Dark/Light Mode)
- `ThemeContext` with React Context API
- Auto-detects system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Manual toggle button in navbar (sun/moon icon)
- Saves preference to `localStorage`
- CSS class strategy (`dark:`) — no flash on reload via inline script in `index.html`
- Smooth 300ms transition on all elements

### Language System (English / Hindi / Marathi)
- `LanguageContext` with React Context API
- JSON translation files for each language (`en.json`, `hi.json`, `mr.json`)
- Language switcher dropdown in navbar
- All section content (headings, descriptions, labels) goes through the translation system
- Saves language preference to `localStorage`
